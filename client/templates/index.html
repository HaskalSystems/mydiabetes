		<p>Thanks for trusting us with your personal information. We understand that some of you may not want your to disclose your personal information, that's ok. Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it.</p>

		<h3>What information does myDiabetes collect and why?</h3>
		<h4>Information from web browsers</h4>

		<p>If you're <strong>just browsing the website</strong>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>

		<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>

		<h5>Why do we collect this?</h5>

		<p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use myDiabetes, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>

		<h4>Information from users with accounts</h4>

		<p>If you <strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email account. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."</p>

		<p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”</p>

		<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p>

		<h5>Why do we collect this?</h5>

		<ul>
			<li>We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request.</li>
			<li>We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on myDiabetes.</li>
			<li>We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.</li>
			<li>We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, <strong>and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay</strong></li>
			<li>We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What information myDiabetes does not collect</h3>

		<p>If you're a <strong>child under the age of 12</strong>, you may have to request permission from your legal guardians (eg: Parents).</p>

		<h3>How we share the information we collect</h3>

		<p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>

		<p>We do not disclose User Personal Information outside myDiabetes, except in the situations listed in this section.</p>

		<p>We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.</p>

		<p>We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under, we remain responsible for it.</p>

		<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.</p>

		<h4>Public Information on myDiabetes</h4>

		<p>Much of myDiabetes is behind a secured area. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing myDiabetes information. (eg: user counts, average usage)</p>

		<p>If you would like to compile myDiabetes data, you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which we have authorized it. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from myDiabetes, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from myDiabetes or myDiabetes users.</p>

		<h3>Our use of cookies and tracking</h3>

		<h4>Cookies</h4>

		<p>myDiabetes uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of myDiabetes.</p>

		<p>A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting myDiabetes; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies myDiabetes sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use myDiabetes’s services.</p>

		<h4>Google Analytics</h4>

		<p>We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don’t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use myDiabetes. This helps us evaluate our users' use of myDiabetes; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance.</p>

		<p>Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of myDiabetes. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.</p>

		<p>myDiabetes will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking</a>.</p>

		<p>Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.</p>

		<h4>Tracking</h4>

		<p>"<a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a>" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection on myDiabetes for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.</p>

		<p>If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a> website has browser-specific instructions.</p>

		<h3>How myDiabetes secures your information</h3>

		<p>myDiabetes takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</p>

		<p>No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

		<h3>myDiabetes's global privacy practices</h3>

		<p><strong>Information that we collect will be stored and processed in Malaysia</strong> in accordance with this Privacy Statement. However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs.</p>

		<p>We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard Contractual Clause agreements.</p>

		<p>In particular:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> myDiabetes provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data.</li>
			<li>  We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.</li>
			<li>  We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the data we have collected.</li>
			<li>  We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Resolving Complaints</h3>

		<p>If you have concerns about the way myDiabetes is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us by emailing our <a href="mailto:haikalizz@prototypestd.cu.ma">Lead Open Source Manager, Haikal Izzuddin</a>. We will respond within 15 days at the latest.</p>

		<h3>How we respond to compelled disclosure</h3>

		<p>myDiabetes may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>

		<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, myDiabetes strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>

		<h4>Data Retention and Deletion</h4>

		<p>myDiabetes will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</p>

		<p>We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.</p>

		<h3>How we communicate with you</h3>

		<p>We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, <strong>and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay</strong>. We also communicate to you through you healthcare provider, if that's okay with you and them.</p>

		<p>Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.</p>

		<h3>Changes to our Privacy Statement</h3>

		<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, myDiabetes may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the email address specified in your account. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check this page frequently.</p>

	<div class="uk-margin">
		<p>We know that security is a main concern when using an internet service, and we're very fussy about it. After all, even our boss uses myDiabetes.</p>

		<h3>System Security</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>System installation using hardened, patched OS</li>
			<li>Dedicated firewall and VPN services to help block unauthorized system access</li>
			<li>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services powered by industry-leading solutions</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Operational Security</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Our primary server operations are regularly audited by our team.</li>
			<li>Systems access logged and tracked for auditing purposes</li>
			<li>Secure document-destruction policies for all sensitive information</li>
			<li>Fully documented change-management procedures</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Software Security</h3>

		<p>We are on the clock 24/7/365 to keep our software and its dependencies up to date eliminating potential security vulnerabilities. We employ a wide range of monitoring solutions for preventing and eliminating attacks to the site.</p>

		<h3>Communications</h3>

		<p>All private data exchanged with myDiabetes is always transmitted over SSL (which is why your dashboard is served over HTTPS, for instance).</p>

		<h3>Employee access</h3>

		<p>No Prototype Studios employees ever access personal user records unless required to for support reasons. Support staff may sign into your account to access settings related to your support issue. When working a support issue we do our best to respect your privacy as much as possible, we only access the records and settings needed to resolve your issue.</p>

		<h3>Maintaining security</h3>

		<p>We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting.  All passwords are filtered from all our logs and are one-way encrypted in the database using <code>bcrypt</code>.  Login information is always sent over SSL.</p>

		<p>We have full time security staff to help identify and prevent new attack vectors. We always test new features in order to rule out potential attacks, such as XSS-protecting wikis, and ensuring that Pages cannot access cookies.</p>
